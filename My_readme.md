# Gobike
## by Mohamed Abd El Motaal


## Dataset

> The data set I used is   __go-bike 19__ and a copy of the __CVS__ file is attached.

> This dataset has "174952" observations with "16" features.Some data contained missing items of informatio and otherr contained out liers. Each ahs been dealt with approperiately as discussed in the exploratory files.

## Summary of Findings

> 1. Vast majority of rides duration in minutes are short ones. With an average of 11.73 minutes and median of 8.5 minutes.

> 2. Age of users for all genders lies in the same stage aproximately 35 years old.

> 3. Lrgest share of users is of males followed by females with a ratio between both that exceeds 4 times number of femal users and the third stage is for users of other gender.

> 4. Vast majority of users are subscribers while there exist a minortity of customers that is much lesser than subscribers (approximately one seventh).

> 5. Each station has the same umber of bikes occupation for departure and returning.

> 6. There is strong correlation between origin and distenation stations.

> 7. There is weak correlation between age and duration in minutes.

> 8. One can not say there is  difference between week working days and the weekends but in general Tues day has the largest proprtion of rideres.

> 9. Vast majority of riders start their rides in first rush hour at approximately 7 :30AM and at the end of the day the second rush hour takes place at approximatley 5:30PM.

> 10. Since sample of male useres is the dominant it becomes logic to have more rides at the start of the day and at the end of the day (12500). Followed by number of female rides (5000) and finally with other gender which was around 500.

> 11. Since sample of subscribers is the dominant it becomes logic to have more rides at the start of the day and at the end of the day especially when taking gender in consideration (40,000 rides for the male subscribers at the begening and the end of the day). Followed by Female subscribers (15,000) and ending with other gender subscribers with 1200 rides.

> 12. Both male and female subscribers reach maximum no of rides at rush hour at the morning. while other gender reach there maximum no. of rides at the afternoon period.

> 13. Also it's hard to tell if the gender has something to do with duration in minutes.


## Key Insights for Presentation
> 1. The timing of the rides is clearly defined on the scale of the 24 hrs. it has two rushing hours for all other variables. These two rushing hours are taking place once in the morning around 7 A.M. and the second takes place at the end of the daylight approximately at 5 P.M. While on the week days scale the mid of the week (Tuesday) has the largest portion of bike riding counts. All these data has collected for a single month (February 2019). For this reason, it's difficult to determine if Tuesday has an advantage to other days of the week on the long term. 
> 2. Most of the rides are featured with small or short duration. They in average last for 10 minutes or less. This to addition to the first point of the discussion may lead into a conclusion that most of the riders are using the bikes as a means of daily transportation from and to their destinations.
> 3. Most of the users in all there genders and types are approximately of the same age stage around 35 yeas old. This can be useful for marketing and age targeting.
> 4. User type has a very distinguishable face. specially that vast majority of the bikes users are from the "Subscriber" type.
